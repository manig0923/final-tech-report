        "**Motivation:** Hospital readmissions among diabetic patients represent a major challenge for patient outcomes and healthcare systems, with unplanned readmissions being associated with worsened health, disrupted continuity of care, and increased healthcare costs as well as mortality rates. The intended use of this dataset is to build a supervised ML pipeline that predicts whether a patient who already has diabetes and has been hospitalized will be readmitted to the hospital within a certain time window using information available at or during discharge, supporting earlier intervention and more positive health outcomes.   \n",

        "**Target Definition:** The target column is Readmitted, which is a categorical column with possible values of NO (patient was not readmitted), <30 (patient was readmitted within 30 days), and >30 (patient was readmitted after 30 days). A positive prediction will mean the patient is at high risk of readmission. A negative prediction will mean the patient is at low risk of being readmitted. False positives (the model predicts the patient to be at high risk of readmission, but in reality the patient is not readmitted) and false negatives (the model predicts the patient to be at low risk, when in reality the patient is readmitted) incur real-world bugt asymmetric costs; false positives would cause a patient to recieve extra attention unecessarily while false negatives would lead a high-risk patient to not receiving the intervention they need and to being later readmitted unexpectedly, which is often associated with worse patient outcomes and higher mortality risk.\n",

        "Several features contain missing or unknown values. The dataset includes only patients who were hospitalized and diagnosed with diabetes, which excludes individuals who were managed entirely in outpatient settings. As a result, this population is skewed towards patients with more severe disease or greater healthcare utilization, and the model may thus not generalize to all diabetic patients. The target outcome \"readmitted\" reflects hospital readmission behavior rather than true clinical categorization. This data was also collected specifically 130 U.S hospitals over a distinct historical period. Changes to healthcare overtime or across geographic regions may impact patient outcome. Demographic variables also may reflect structural inequities in healthcare access and treatment, which may cause variation in model performance across subgroups. Finally, Readmissions may occur for reasons unrelated to diabetes management, which could potentially introduce noise into the label."

This imabalce means that the majority class could be favored when modeling and it would fail to correclty predict the patients at high risk of early readmission. Addressing the problem we want to solve, this would lead to not enough identification of the patients who need urgent follow-ups which would worsen their health."

If it is included in the model, high performance would be created artifically because the models could memorize these rows and not learn patterns. Another plausable leakage vector could be time_in_hospital because it is recorded after the hospital stay and could direclty relfect the outcome that's trying to be predicted and not be available during prediction time. To prevent leakage, both columns would need to be excluded from the feature set so the model only uses information that would be available at the time of prediction."
